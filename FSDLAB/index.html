            <p>
                I am a motivated and enthusiastic student with a strong interest in technology and
                full stack development. My academic journey has helped me build a solid foundation
                in programming, web technologies, and problem-solving skills. I enjoy learning how
                front-end and back-end systems work together to create complete applications.
                I am constantly exploring new tools and technologies to improve my technical knowledge.
                I believe in continuous learning and practical implementation of concepts.
                My goal is to grow as a skilled professional and contribute meaningfully to the tech industry.
